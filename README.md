### What is this repository for? ###

This repo contains scripts to:

* Extract training data from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 images using shapefiles or GeoTiffs.
* Trains a classifier to convert images into probability of forest
* Identifies deforestation events in time series.

### How do I get set up? ###

At present, it's best to contact me if you'd like to use these scripts. They are still very much under development, and outputs are not stable.

### What's not working yet? ###

The classifier is not yet producing stable results, with poor outputs particularly in the late dry season.

### How does it work? ###

Full documentation will be hosted at: [http://deforest.readthedocs.io/](http://deforest.readthedocs.io/).
